<p>The <b>Object List Page</b> shows a list of all of the objects that
are associated with a variable in the model you are currently viewing
information for in the app.  The page is initially blank for models
that have just been added using the <b>Add New Model</b> button on the
<b>Model List Page</b>.  To add object names to this list, press the
<b>Add Object</b> button at the bottom and then choose an object from
the list.</p>

<p>Below each object name there are four small buttons.  The first three
buttons are labeled:
<font ion-text color="primary"> <b>Q</b> </font> for Quantities,
<font ion-text color="primary"> <b>P</b> </font> for Processes and
<font ion-text color="primary"> <b>A</b> </font> for Assumptions.
Press one of these to associate additional quantities, processes or
assumptions with the corresponding object name. The last button has a
<font ion-text color="primary"> <b>trash can</b> </font> icon and is used to
delete an object name from the list, along with any additional
information about quantities, processes and assumptions that may have
been added previously.
</p>

<p>In the Geoscience Standard Names (GSN) ontology, <b>object names</b>
start with "container words" that provide necessary context in order to
unambiguously identify a particular object.  Separate words are separated
by <font ion-text color="primary"> <b>underscores,</b> </font> which can
often be read as <b>"has a"</b>. (Actual relationships between consecutive
words in an object name are stored in the ontology as predicates.)
<font ion-text color="primary"> <b>Hyphens</b> </font> are used to bind words that
refer to the same entity, such as <b>carbon-dioxide</b>.
Any word following a <font ion-text color="primary"> <b>tilde</b> </font>
is an adjective to be applied to the preceding object name part.
<b>Adjectives</b> are used to restrict the space of possibilities so that
the entire object name is clear and unambiguous, referring to a unique object.
<!-- Multiple adjectives can be applied to the same object name part. -->
</p>

<p>You will see that together, the context/container words and the trailing
adjectives provide a nice alphabetical ordering to the object names and
the variable names constructed from them.
</p>

<p>Note that a given word can sometimes be used as either an object
name or a process name.  Examples include <b>radiation</b>, <b>flow</b>
and <b>melt</b>.  Whenever one of these words occurs in a GSN object
name, it indicates an object and not a process.  You will see that process
names frequently occur in quantity names, for quantities that characterize
the corresponding process (e.g infiltration).</p>
