  "purpose"   : "This process component is part of a spatially-distributed hydrologic model called TopoFlow, but it can now be used as a stand-alone model. The kinematic wave method (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955) is the simplest method for modeling flow in open channels. This method combines mass conservation with the simplest possible treatment of momentum conservation, namely that all terms in the general momentum equation (pressure gradient, local acceleration and convective acceleration) are neglible except the friction and gravity terms. A flow in which gravitational acceleration is exactly balanced by friction is referred to as steady, uniform flow. For these flows the water surface slope, energy slope and bed slope are all equal.",

SNAC can solve momentum and heat energy balance equations in 3D solid with complicated rheology.  Lagrangian description of motion adopted in SNAC makes it easy to monitor surface deformation during a crustal or continental scale tectonic event as well as introduce surface processes into a model.",

PIHM is a physical model for surface and groundwater, “tightly-coupled” to a GIS interface. PIHMgis which is open source, platform independent and extensible. The tight coupling between GIS and the model is achieved by developing a shared data-model and hydrologic-model data structure.",
