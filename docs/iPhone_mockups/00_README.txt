This folder contains an iPhone 6s mockup image in both PNG and GIMP XCF formats, called:
   iPhone6s_870_1765.png
   iPhone6s_870_1765.xcf

These images are sized so that the image created by saving a screenshot on the iPhone 6s can be pasted into the mockup without adjusting the size of the screenshot image.  The folder "iPhone_screenshots" contains actual screenshot images that were pasted in this way to create the other images in this folder.
